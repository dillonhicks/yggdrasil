Need for a Legal Informations Tool Suite

- Information retrieval (IR) done by humans

    - laborious 
    - tedious
    - Costly

- Why it hasn't been done by computers

    - Complicated
    
        - Law is a bazillion years old and has just as many flavors as jurisdictions.
        - Makes the parsing of historical legal documents difficult
 
- Benefits to being done by computers

    - Richer information 
        
        - Graphs
        - Precident rank (like pagerank for law)
    
    - Could be able to research law faster without the heavy reliance of paralegals


- How?

    - To be able to have any useful information from legal documents
      we would need to:

    - (Minimum)

        - Identify the document uniquely, presumably by its citation
        - Know where it falls historically
        - The documents referenced by the document and the documents referencing it
        - If the document still sets a precident, has been overturned, etc. 

    - Further, being able to give the user of our tools some ability
      to know the subject of its content and which areas of law to
      which it is pertinent would be awesome, but out of the scope of
      phase0.
