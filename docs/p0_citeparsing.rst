Citation Parsing

**Background**

Parsing the legal citations to uniquely identify a legal document is
indispensible.

- A unique cite would give a handle by which a document could be
  stored electronically.

- The blue book is huge. Parsing all of the citations in the first
  pass might be a waste of time.

- That being said, there would be some low hanging fruit as we can
  determine that cases that make it ot the state supreme courts and
  the federal courts will likely have a bigger impact than those at
  the more local levels.

**Desired Phase0 Outcomes**

- Be able to accurately parse citations for at least 75% of some
  candidate dataset.

-
