# Abbreviations for Court Documents
#
# Source: 
#  The Bluebook 18th Ed. (2008). p25-26 / BT-1
#
# Rules and Suggestions:
# 
# - The following are the *suggested* abbreviations (or lack of
#   abbreviation, if appropriate) for common words in legal documents.
#
# - Further, the BB states that words of 6+ characters may be
#   abbreviated if the abbreviation is unambiguous to the reader.
#
#      - For such titles, it is recommended to omit articles and
#        prepositions if it does not introduce ambiguity. 
# 
#      - For any given document, if an ad-hoc abbreviation is used it
#        should be consistent throughout the document.
#

# Possible Todos:
# 
# - Create dictionaries mapping abr->word and word->abr
# - Create regexes to match these in documents.
# - Find a way to give these "context"
