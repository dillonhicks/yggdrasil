Legal Citation Parsing

One of the biggest challenges in creating a "big data" datamining
framework for legal information is the lack of standardization in
legal documations. This lack of standardization comes from the varying
geographical jurisdictions, distillation through multiple
historical epochs, and varying other sources.

The goal of this project was to (re)-create some of the framework that
was abandoned in a previous project of mine. The framework was aimed
at parsing as many of the legal citations into computational data
structures that could be used to uniquely identify legal documents. 

Once that framework is in place, one should be able to use standard
natural language and network (graph) tools in order to analyze the
meaning and "weight" of a legal document.
